 include a short writeup describing your project, whatâ€™s contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

The purpose of my final project was to create a web app for plant lovers to connect with other plant lovers and have an exchange of plants, cuttings, or seeds. 
The style of the site was designed similar to craigslist but for plants specifically. Although different from craigslist you must register for an account before you can view postings or make listings of your own. The main index page contains all listings that you can browse through and select to view more info and even send a message to the poster and see if you can trade any plants/seeds/cuttings you might have or work out another deal. Addidtionaly you can make your own listing and must add a title, description, plant type, plant shape, and upload a picture. Once you have several of your own listings on the main page you can go to view only your listings and choose to delete any listings you no longer want active on the site. I utilized forms.py which gathers the non-auto generated fields from my models as a way to implement the file upload feature.
